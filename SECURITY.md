## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When using Windows Defense LogoFAIL, follow these security best practices:

1. **Installation Security**
   - Download only from official GitHub repository
   - Verify script signatures when available
   - Run with least necessary privileges
   - Review scripts before execution

2. **Configuration Security**
   - Use strong authentication for alert systems
   - Secure log file storage locations
   - Regularly update configuration settings
   - Enable audit logging for administrative actions

3. **Operational Security**
   - Monitor system logs for anomalies
   - Regularly review alert configurations
   - Keep Windows and PowerShell updated
   - Implement defense-in-depth strategies

4. **Incident Response**
   - Have incident response procedures ready
   - Test backup and recovery processes
   - Document security configurations
   - Maintain contact information for security issues

### For Developers

When contributing to the project, follow these security guidelines:

1. **Secure Coding Practices**
   - Validate all input parameters
   - Use parameterized queries for external commands
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Avoid hard-coded credentials or secrets

2. **Access Control**
   - Follow principle of least privilege
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Use secure communication protocols
   - Audit access to sensitive functions

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - Include security test cases
   - Perform code security reviews
   - Test with different privilege levels
   - Validate input sanitization

4. **Documentation**
   - Document security assumptions
   - Provide security configuration guidance
   - Include threat model information
   - Maintain security-relevant comments

## Known Security Considerations

### PowerShell Execution Policy

- **Risk**: PowerShell execution policies can be bypassed
- **Mitigation**: Rely on authentication and authorization rather than execution policy alone
- **Recommendation**: Use application whitelisting and code signing where possible

### Administrative Privileges

- **Risk**: Scripts require elevated privileges for full functionality
- **Mitigation**: Minimize privilege usage and validate admin requirements
- **Recommendation**: Use separate accounts for administrative tasks

### Credential Storage

- **Risk**: Alert system credentials stored in configuration files
- **Mitigation**: Use Windows credential storage or encrypted configuration
- **Recommendation**: Implement proper key management for production environments

### Log File Security

- **Risk**: Log files may contain sensitive information
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper file permissions and access controls
- **Recommendation**: Regular log rotation and secure archival

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Process

1. **Detection**: Security issue identified through monitoring or reporting
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and severity of the security issue
3. **Containment**: Implement immediate measures to limit exposure
4. **Investigation**: Detailed analysis of the security incident
5. **Resolution**: Develop and deploy fixes for the security issue
6. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations and validate security posture
7. **Lessons Learned**: Document incident and improve security measures

### Emergency Contacts
